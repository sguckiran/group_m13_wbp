  "history": "The Sustainability Advisory Committee (SAC) was founded in 2021 by a small group of Norwich-based environmental advocates and university researchers. What began as a volunteer-led discussion group soon evolved into a local advisory body, helping policy makers, councils, and organizations align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We hope to guide Norwich and its neighbouring areas toward a greener, fairer future!",
